# calculator
Fully functional javascript calculator!

This calculator does it all! 

You want multiple decimals at one time? NOPE, doesnt allow that because you can't do that mathmatically.

You want to input multiple operands for the fun of it?  Well, it does allow it but it changes the input to allow correct computation! (e.g. Input = 5+-*5 Output = 5*5)

Enjoy!
